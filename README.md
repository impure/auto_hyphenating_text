## Features

TODO: List what your package can do. Maybe include images, gifs, or videos.

## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.
-->

## Usage

This package needs to be initialized using the following:

```dart
await initHyphenation();
```

This will load the hyphenation algorithm. Alternately you can not do this and specify the resource file manually every time you call `AutoHyphenatingText`.

Then it can be used as a drop in replacement for normal text. So

```dart
Text("abc");
```

becomes

```dart
AutoHyphenatingText("abc");
```

contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
